            <p class="desc">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
                presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
                 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
                 colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in 
                the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
                by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in 
                the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load 
                speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:
                The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
                The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
                Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
                Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
